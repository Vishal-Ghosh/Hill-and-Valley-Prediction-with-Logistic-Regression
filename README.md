# Hill-and-Valley-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression
- **Project Title**: Hill and Valley Prediction Using Logistic Regression
- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to classify geographical features as hills or valleys based on given attributes.
- **Dataset**: Utilized a public dataset containing topographical data points with features indicating the terrain's elevation.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
  - Scaled features to standardize the range of independent variables.
- **Feature Selection**:
  - Conducted correlation analysis to identify and remove redundant features.
  - Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
- **Modeling**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
  - Trained a logistic regression model to predict binary classification (hill or valley).
- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Analyzed confusion matrix to understand model's prediction capabilities and errors.
- **Results**:
  - Achieved an accuracy of 96.43% on the test set.
  - Highlighted the modelâ€™s ability to effectively distinguish between hills and valleys.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
